# Debugging, Testing, and Publishing a Flutter App

Wired Brain Coffee Company decided to rewrite their existing app to Flutter to introduce a better-looking app and have a single code base to manage Android and iOS. Flutter Developers encounter bugs and face errors that break the app, impacting their productivity and app stability confidence and increasing customer complaints. Thus, they decided to invest in their skills to debug properly by learning all possible tools and sending better error reports to an error reporting system. While they catch those errors and fix them, write unit and integration tests to ensure that mistakes never happen again. Ultimately, they automate the deployment of their app to deliver it to the end-user, which works.
